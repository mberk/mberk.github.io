Welcome to Diary of a Kaggler. Here you'll find details of my efforts in
competing on [kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com), a website hosting data science
competitions. From time to time I'll also branch out into other personal
data analysis and software development projects. Posts are presented as
tutorials on a diverse range of topics from programming to automation to
systems administration. My sincere hope is that with each post you'll learn
something new and apply that knowledge to your own data science endeavours.

If you'd like to get in touch, I'd be delighted to hear from you. You can
email me at [maurice@mauriceberk.com](mailto:maurice@mauriceberk.com) or
connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mauriceberk).

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and based on
[Nick Balestra](http://nick.balestra.ch/)'s
[Kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) theme. It's hosted on
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) - feel free to clone the
[repository](http://www.github.com/mberk/mberk.github.io)!
